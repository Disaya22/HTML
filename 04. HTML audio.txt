Audio
⦁	We can include audio in a web page using HTML. We need some audio files to work with
⦁	You can download MP3 files from the youtube audio library

#file index.html
<audio>
        <source src="IDrinkWine.mp3">
</audio>

⦁	We should have any controls to let the song play right away

#file index.html
<audio controls autoplay muted loop>
       	<source src="IDrinkWine.mp3">
</audio>
